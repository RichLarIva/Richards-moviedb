# Richards-moviedb
 This site was made to learn more about API's expecially in the sense of making a movie related website. The main concept of this site is to be able to see popular media as of this day in no specific order.

 **Problems I had in this project:**
 - The main problem I had with this project was finding the correct API to use.
 - The other issue I had was making a decent design, so towards the end I decided that tailwind would be used to allow me to more easily make a nicer design.

 **Things I would do if I had more time to develop this project**
 - First thing I would do would be to figure out how to get the genre of the movie/series as the API I used, had genre id's rather than the name of the genre forcing me to make more advanced code.
 - I would focus more on the design.
